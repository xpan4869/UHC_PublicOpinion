where the core competency problems lie  but regardless  the buck stops with Aetna and they ve clearly failed to put the screws to Softheon to fix their shit            In hindsight  these should have been the first warning signs     While it doesn t really affect anything  let s just start with the glaring quantity of unlocalized strings _everywhere_ in the payment portal   https   imgur com a yXZv fs  An unlocalized string popping up in some dusty corner of the site would be fine  really  but _the site header_    The page description of the landing page and every plan summary title    Even better  it s been this way _for over a year_   I m a software developer  Frontend isn t really my thing  but I ve done a bit of it here and there  I can t fathom how something like this made it into production in the first place  let alone how you d just let that shit ride for an entire year  Sure  it s a trivial issue  but it s also highly visible  and that just makes it all the more baffling that they didn t fix it ASAP   It s a canary in the coalmine  If this is their standard for the customer facing visible aspects of their site  just imagine what the security and business logic must look like under the hood              Extreme unreliability coupled with failure to communicate  I ve been with Aetna for   years  regrettably  After what happened the first year  I should have dropped them  but I didn t  Lesson learned                The first incident  I had autopayments set up  About   months in  my card expired  I didn t catch it  and the payment failed  That s fine and totally not their fault  What _is_ their fault is that I received absolutely no notification whatsoever that the payment had failed  My first indication that anything had gone wrong was when I went to a doctor s appointment and found out my insurance had been cancelled   I got with support and got things reinstated  I told them about how I had received no notifications  They promised they d look into it  spoiler alert  they didn t                The second incident  After the first incident  I put things on manual pay for a while  but that got tedious so I set up autopayments again  Towards the end of the year  for no reason that anyone was ever able to explain  it just didn t process a payment one month  Again  this was never communicated and I only found I was termed when I tried to pick up prescription   I tried to make a manual payment to clear it up  Generic  unable to process your payment  message  Wait    hours  try again   Unable to process your payment   I waited another    hours and called support to make a payment by phone  only to find out that all of the errors were bullshit and that it had  in fact  processed _both_ manual payments successfully  giving me a negative balance into the next year  They could offer no explanation for why this happened   I once again informed them that I was receiving no notice of payment problems  They promised to look into it again               The third incident  Similar to the second incident  early this year their autopayment system accepted payment one month  then mysteriously did a charge back of the premium about    days later  putting me in arrears and getting me termed again  Still no communication of failure  I checked with the bank  and they didn t have anything to do with it  Aetna couldn t explain why this had happened  I told them for the  rd time that I wasn t getting any notification of payment problems  They ll look into it               The fourth incident  After the last one  I went on manual payments again  Eventually tedium wore me down again and I set up autopayments again  Six weeks later  surprise  I ve been termed again  I check the autopayment plan and   it s gone  Just not there anymore  He said she said  but I _know_ I set it up  And yet again  I was never informed of a missed payment or that I was getting termed   To their credit  after   failed promises to look into the communication problem  they finally fixed whatever it was  For the first time in two years  I m actually getting informed of when a bill has been issued if payment is due         The final straw  To be honest  the  th billing incident was already the last straw  but today I was informed by Headway  big billing marketing insurance platform for mental health providers  that     Aetna went through internal changes this year  causing them to reexamine their Individual and Family Plan agreements with large organizations like Headway  As a result  Headway will no longer be able to serve Aetna members like you who have Individual and Family Plans beginning on January           I don t know the details  and I don t care  Aetna is giving the finger to individual and family plans  so if you re thinking about choosing them on the marketplace  DON T   All of this is on top of constantly fighting my doctors on what medication I need and just general  let s deny every benefit we think we can get away with  fuckery throughout   That s it  I m done  I m past done  This has been an exceptionally horrible experience even relative to the already awful American healthcare and private insurance

hospital billed about       my insurance reduced the cost and I ended up paying just under  k  However when I had the second one in October  I recieved the compete breakdown from the Hospital  and it was exactly as I d expected  However  the billing was held up on the UHC side for nearly a year  so i wasnt asked to pay it by the hospital until recently    I was sent the explanation of benefits and immediately realized something was wrong    Uhc showed the       billed fir the surgery  which matched my hospital billing statement  Plus a NYS surcharge of          Those are as expected  But then  the next line items showed         discounted and         additionally paid to the hospital  Plus a       NYS surcharge paid  And another line item for       urgent care item that was  discounted  and a        NYS Surcharge  also  discounted   These are all found under the same claim number on the same Explaination of benefits  When I look below at the descriptions  for the   k item it s an S   this claim was processed at      because your out of pocket deductible has been met  For the urgent care discounted amount  it s a  H and says  we recieved more information and reprocessed the claim    I contacted the hospital  They confirmed the amounts billed were exclusively the       plus the surcharge  and that they d recieved an overpayment from UHC and don t understand why  I recieved no additional care or urgent care  I contacted UHC and they contacted UHC several times over a month time  UhC advised me that there s no max payout on my insurance and so it doesn t effect me bcuz they aren t asking me to pay the amount  and brushed Me off  I told them  if it s not mine  I don t want it on my record  I explained the full billing breakdown and my past surgery as well  so I know its wrong  Every minute and every med is accounted for  She eventually indicated the   k may have even for an injection  and was unsure what the urgent care is  because they can t see what I was billed for by the hospital  only the codes they recieved  it s not done line by line  she said  One rep told me it could be a billing item for another customer in California but it doesn t matter because I m not being asked to pay it bcuz I was at my deductible    To me this is crazy they keep telling me this     She explained it was assigned to a CRT project and was on hold for an extended time period  and in that project they do  mass adjustments    One rep described this as    when a retroactive payment is made to a provider pertaining what UHC owes a provider for other payments but does not have anything to do with my claims or services      The hospital billing department was also told this was part of a UHC billing project too  and it was on hold  UhC reprocessed resubmit the claim early Nov and it wound up showing the same details as before  no change  except now they want me to pay the hospital the      and confirmed these amounts are accurate  Which they are not   I submit my appeal  I provided the bills from the Hospital and all the inaccurate Explainations of benefits  They reviewed the claim  and closed my appeal  stating the payments are correct   I emailed the hospital  who responded  you are right  something is not right with the UHC payment    UHC called me  The woman and I argued for     minutes  She insists they reviewed it  and it s correct  She cannot tell me what the amounts covered for services I recieved  or why this would be paid using my benefits  The only explaination she would now give was that my account was part of a project and the hospital and UHC renegotiated my contract in October      and now UHC is responsible for paying the hospital the average amount fir a similar surgery claim  So it doesn t matter if my care was only  k billed  I asked for a copy my of the contract  to which she said it s a contract with the hospital and I m not allowed to have a copy  I asked what my next steps are because I completely disagree with this being paid out from my insurance benefit  She gave me a PObox to write a complaint to  But honestly I didn t yet bcuz it feels like what is the point    They arent taking this seriously or even accurately investigating the issue   My main issues here are that  if UHC does this to say       insured people  this will dramatically increase our average in claims paid  and eventually will raise everyone s premiums and out of pocket expenses  because the analytics on this would show that I personally used   k more in my Healthcare benefits  than I really did  So this is impactful data  Additionally  I don t want MY heath insurance that I work hard and pay fir  paying for other patients  or illegals for all I know  through some contractual loophole with NYS or UHC behind our backs  MY insurance should only be paying the amounts I ve accrued and recieved care for  or they should be providing me proof of why those ancients are on my health insurance  I m so frustrated  I don t know what else to do    call the news  What regulatory agency audits uhc  Can I send them a letter  NYS  I need this to be escalated  Can you imagine the impact if they are doing this to thousands of patients or elderly people who don t notice  Or who listen to the repeated excuses and poor explanations that make no sense  What action can I take',\n",
